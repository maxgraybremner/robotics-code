1007ICT "Introduction to Robotics"
Griffith University 
School of Information and Communication Technology 

The assessment for the introduction to robotics course held in trimester 1,
requires students to design, document, and implement a dual arduino based robotics system.
For this task, I prototyped an autonomous garden monitoring and feeding system using 
LCD screen, three environemtal sensors, a servo motor, and a solar panel input.
The code for the two ardunios can be viewed through the relevant c++ source code files 
and a picture of the system can be found as the png.

If you would like to simulate, create, modify, or improve the system, please do so 
through the tinkercad link provided below and if you would like to share any thoughts 
on this project, please message me through my GitHub.
